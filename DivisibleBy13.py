# When you divide the successive powers of 10 by 13 you get the following remainders of the integer divisions:
# 1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4.
# Then the whole pattern repeats.
# Hence the following method:
# Multiply the right most digit of the number with the left most number
# in the sequence shown above, the second right most digit to the second
# left most digit of the number in the sequence. The cycle goes on and
# you sum all these products.
#
# Repeat this process until the sequence of sums is stationary.

# Example: What is the remainder when 1234567 is divided by 13?
# 7×1 + 6×10 + 5×9 + 4×12 + 3×3 + 2×4 + 1×1 = 178
# We repeat the process with 178:
#     8x1 + 7x10 + 1x9 = 87
# and again with 87:
#     7x1 + 8x10 = 87
