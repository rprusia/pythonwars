# Given an array/list [] of n integers, Arrange them in a way similar
# to the to-and-fro movement of a Pendulum
# The Smallest element of the list of integers,
# must come in center position of array/list.
# The Higher than smallest, goes to the right .
# The Next higher number goes to the left of minimum number
# and So on , in a to-and-fro manner similar to that of a Pendulum.
